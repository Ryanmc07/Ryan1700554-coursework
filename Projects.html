              <div class="col-12 col-md-4">
                <h2>Wild Scot Trust</h2>
                <p>During my time at The Gordon Schools I had the opportunity to study Advanced Higher Computing Science. When participating in this course I had to create a website for a Wild Trust Scotland which was a bird spotting organisation. This website would need to take information in via a form on the website, and then use that data to generate a query (using SQL) to find the particular bird and information about the bird such as where to find the bird in Scotland. This was done by linking the website to a database using the local server host XAMPP.</p>

              <div class="col-12 col-md-4">
                <h2>Curriculum Vitae Website</h2>
                <p>This particular project made me develop my wesite coding skills further than the Wild Scot Trust project, this is because I had to use more advanced features like frameworks and linking in data from third parties the Twitter. During the development of this project I would have to create three pages these being a Home page an CV page, this would display all my awards and grades, and also a Contact page. This project would then be uploaded to GitHub.  </p>

                  <h2>RC Car</h2>
                  <p>Within this team project we were to create an Remote Control Car, this RC car was to be able to be controlled via the software called processing. We were also to include componets like an LDR, which we decided to use the LDR to control the lights of the RC car. The RC car had to be able to use an ardunio uno board, so that the compents all comunicated to eachother, this meant we had to use serial ports so that the ardunio could comunicate with the processing software. We also linked a camera to processing so that the user was able to see where the car was.</p>
